\usage{
compute_overlap(
  results_list,
  padj_threshold = 0.05,
  lfc_threshold = 1,
  direction = "both"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_list}{A list of DE results from different methods}

\item{padj_threshold}{Adjusted p-value threshold (default: 0.05)}

\item{lfc_threshold}{Absolute log2 fold change threshold (default: 1)}

\item{direction}{Filter by direction: "both", "up", "down" (default: "both")}
}
\value{
A list containing overlap data and statistics
}
\description{
Computes detailed overlap statistics and Venn diagram data.
}
